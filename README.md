OpenAI, for generating human-like text. GPT-2, which stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2," is designed to produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

Key Objectives:

Model Overview: Understand the architecture and training methodology of GPT-2, which includes a deep neural network with 1.5 billion parameters trained on diverse internet text. Text Generation: Implement and fine-tune GPT-2 for generating creative and contextually appropriate text across various domains such as storytelling, summarization, or dialogue systems. Evaluation: Assess the quality of the generated text using metrics like coherence, relevance, and creativity, and compare results with human-generated content. Outcome:

The project aims to showcase GPT-2's ability to produce high-quality, human-like text and explore its applications in different fields, including content creation, automated responses, and more.
